If you are looking to learn more about cyber insurance and the role it plays in a risk management program, please join the (ISC)² North Bay Chapter for our virtual event entitled “Cyber Risk Insurance - Challenges Choosing The Right Coverage for Your Business". This event will be held Tuesday, Nov 2, 2021 from 6:00 PM PST to 7:30 PM PST, for 1.5 CPE hours.
A few years ago, no one had heard of cyber insurance. Today, everyone either wants it or has it; but most organizations are not sure if they have the right one. Having an insurance policy that is expressly dedicated to covering cyber-related incidents is critical; however, not all cyber insurance policies are created equal. In this event, our speakers, Amy Wood (CEO of Copper Penny Consulting) and Justin Reinmuth (CEO of Techrug) will go through the ‘ins and outs’ of cyber insurance and examine real-world examples to fully understand the scope of what a cyber insurance policy actually covers in the case of an incident, and what organization should think about when shopping for a policy.
